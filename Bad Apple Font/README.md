# How does it work

2. Convert them to SVG
3. Map each one to a font character
4. Generate file

# How to run

- To generate the font, simply run the [generate.ps1](src/generate.ps1) script and then run the [start_server.ps1](start_server.ps1) to start a HTTP server which will display an animation using the generated font.
